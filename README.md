E-com-Website

The basic objective of this project is to build and design an e-commerce website for the daily users.

The website allows users to put products into their cart and buy which ever products they would like from a variety of products.

Users are required to register with the website to access the store; this registration requires them to fill out a form with all the personal details of the customer, like address, name, email, password, etc. Before entering this user information into the database the data is first encrypted and then added onto our servers. 
This keeps the integrity of user information as it is encrypted in the database
